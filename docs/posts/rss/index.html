This project aims to create a design that consolidates our HV connections and makes maintenance significantly easier.</p><h2 id="the-current-problem">The current problem</h2><p></p><p>As you can see below, currently we have a mess of 1/0 gauge wire sprawling between countess contactors, fuses, current sensors, and connectors. This network of wire is used for connecting our battery pack to our motors, chargers, solar array, and LV systems. What we currently have is a nightmare to work with and makes seemingly simple tasks such as changing fuses an hour long ordeal.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2023/07/p15.jpg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Solar Car HV Bus Bar Distribution" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/p15.jpg 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/p15.jpg 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/07/p15.jpg 1600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2023/07/p15.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2023/07/High-Voltage-Mess.jpg" width="1585" height="2019" loading="lazy" alt="Solar Car HV Bus Bar Distribution" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/High-Voltage-Mess.jpg 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/High-Voltage-Mess.jpg 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2023/07/High-Voltage-Mess.jpg 1585w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Current Solar Car, P15 Eliana (left), Current HV Dumpster Fire (Right)</figcaption></figure><p>The main reason that our current setup is such a mess is because the American Solar Challenge regulations require contactors and fuses at most points through the HV chain leading to many breaks between wires. We also have a problem where the specialty fuses we have to buy do not have fuse holders available so we have to put them inline in a wire as seen above.</p><h2 id="solution-requirements">Solution Requirements</h2><p></p><p>Below are the requirements I came up with for the design of the HV bussing solution.</p><ul><li>No doubling up cables on a single screw terminal</li><li>Properly sized lugs and wire gauge based on the connection</li><li>Captive, clinched, or crimped nuts for the bolted connections</li><li>Dedicated holders for all current sensors and fuses</li><li>Automotive grade panel mount connectors</li><li>Use bus bars over cables whenever possible</li><li>Integrated Compact Design</li></ul><p>One of the challenges with creating a design for this was deciding on contactors, fuses, and current sensors.

One issue I am running into is that two of the four bulbs on the colons don&apos;t seem to light up consistently. I&apos;ve read online about needing time for the bulbs to polarize and as they do turn on some of the time I think that&apos;s what the problem is. </p><p>This has been one of my favorite projects because it was very interdisciplinary in the amount of skills that I had to use in order to complete it. Second, thanks mostly to the superb quality of the SLA print (plus 2 coats of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-7701830-Stops-12-Ounce-Crystal/dp/B0010NY95S/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=rustoleum+clear+coat&amp;qid=1688166688&amp;sr=8-10&amp;ref=caden-kraft">Rust-Oleum Crystal Clear Enamel</a>), this project looks the most polished and least DIY out of anything I&apos;ve ever done.

However there are a few smaller projects that haven&apos;t been tackled yet. </p><p>One of these projects is redesigning the steering wheel. The current steering wheel in the car has given us many problems that have greatly inhibited our ability to drive reliability without breaking down. Looking at the image of the disassembled current steering wheel below you can see that it mostly consists of a waterjet sheet of carbon fiber with holes drilled for the quick disconnect fitting and the buttons used for turn signals, hazards, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/06/IMG_20211114_131833__01.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Making a Solar Car Steering Wheel" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1805" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/IMG_20211114_131833__01.jpg 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/IMG_20211114_131833__01.jpg 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/06/IMG_20211114_131833__01.jpg 1600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/06/IMG_20211114_131833__01.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Old P15 Steering Wheel Disassembled</figcaption></figure><p>The problem with this design is that the wires that connect to the buttons to the aptly named buttonboard PCB that controls them, get individually routed to buttonboard deeper into the car. This means that when rotating the steering wheel, as there are more than 15 individual wires being rotated, over time some either develop a loose connection or snap off entirely.</p><p>As the steering wheel controls everything from turn signals to our regenerative braking we cannot have these faults inhibit us from driving at race this summer.</p><p>Some other smaller issues with this design are that as the holes for the buttons are drilled, the number of them and their positions are fixed and can only be redone by re-waterjetting the main carbon panel which can cost up to $50 in materials and machine time. The hole pattern was also drilled by hand with no CAD available which makes creating a strain relief component that integrates with the current design quite challenging.</p><p>Taking all this in mind I started on defining the requirements I was going to set for myself for the new design to meet.</p><hr><ul><li>Integrate the buttonboard PCB into the steering wheel itself</li><li>Limit the connection from the steering wheel to the car to a single wire</li><li>Provide the ability for the button position and count to be quickly redesigned if needed</li><li>Utilize 3D printed parts as much as possible and mechanical fasteners over adhesives</li></ul><hr><p>With these in mind I started to design the steering wheel. I jumped into Inventor and started modeling and after a few hours was left with my first iteration.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/06/rev1-back.png" width="1185" height="1062" loading="lazy" alt="Making a Solar Car Steering Wheel" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/rev1-back.png 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/rev1-back.png 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/06/rev1-back.png 1185w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/06/rev1-buttons.png" width="858" height="695" loading="lazy" alt="Making a Solar Car Steering Wheel" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/rev1-buttons.png 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/06/rev1-buttons.png 858w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/06/rev1-front.png" width="1111" height="1104" loading="lazy" alt="Making a Solar Car Steering Wheel" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/rev1-front.png 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/rev1-front.png 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/06/rev1-front.png 1111w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Various views of the first iteration steering wheel design</figcaption></figure><p>As seen above, there are many aspects to the new design including the integration of the buttonboard PCB shown as a placeholder in green, with the smaller PCB being the compute module needed to run the code. There are also 3D printed redesignable inserts for the buttons combined with an RJ45 Ethernet jack used in order to transmit power and CAN data from buttonboard to the rest of the car.</p><p>I showed this design to the team and received a lot of really helpful feedback. The core areas of feedback are as follows.</p><hr><ul><li>This design is larger than the current one and takes up more space in the solar car. Some drivers noted that the current one already got in the way often</li><li>Much of the PCB and compute module are unprotected which could lead to damage from it being handled so much</li><li>PCB shape and size could lead to increased manufacturing cost from the PCB fabricator</li><li>Add some sort of gasket between the PCB and carbon panel</li></ul><hr><p>With this feedback I embarked on creating a second more compact and integrated design that could also fufill the new requirements of smaller size as well as protecting and optimizing the shape of the PCB. </p><p>I culminated this all into a brand new design to which a draggable view of it is seen below.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="max-width: 1912px; max-height: 1230px;">

Although I can host it on my server I currently cannot port-forward traffic to my blog, and it also introduces a pretty significant security risk. &#xA0;</p><p>Bring in Github pages. Github pages is a great way to host websites completely for free with the one cavitate being that they have to be completely static. As Ghost doesn&apos;t natively support this to my knowledge, this is where the guide begins.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Server/Laptop/PC you have to host the server on for local editing.

Going forward, I will be listing commands that would be used on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems as that is what I personally used, but they should be similar for other platforms. To install Docker, we can run these commands below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release nano git curl</code></pre><figcaption>Download apt packages</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-bash">curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg</code></pre><figcaption>Add Docker GPG key</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-bash">echo \

Their versatility cost and ease of use have allowed me to implement them into a wide range of projects and learn a lot about computing.</p><p>One area I had never ventured however was the idea of clustered computing. Making a compute cluster out of Raspberry Pi&apos;s had always seemed like a popular project that people do but I personally had never seen a use for one.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster" loading="lazy" width="960" height="640" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-14.png 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/image-14.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Oracle Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster</figcaption></figure><p>However, after watching some videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg?ref=caden-kraft">Jeff Geerling</a> I was interested. Luckily enough I just so happened to have 4 Raspberry Pi 3b+&apos;s that currently had no use. After doing some research the consensus came to be that Pi 4&apos;s are recommended for making clusters and 3&apos;s might be a bit slow but I&apos;m mostly doing it as a learning experience as opposed to a necessity.</p><p>Looking at the designs people have made previously for Raspberry Pi clusters I was disappointed to see that the actual mechanical design of the enclosures/lack-thereof was quite lacking in my opinion so I wanted to make my own. I tasked myself with designing a new enclosure satisfying these requirements.</p><ul><li>Tool-less install of the Raspberry Pi&apos;s</li><li>Streamlined power delivery (No big micro-USB cables)</li><li>3D printable with as few parts as possible</li><li>Integrated network switch and active cooling</li></ul><p>Here is the final design that I came up with. The view below is draggable to see the full model.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="max-width: 1912px; max-height: 1230px;">

</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The center black component is designed to be 3D printed without supports with integrated tool-less clips to firmly hold all of the Raspberry Pi&apos;s without any hardware. The panels around the 3D printed part are designed to be laser cut out of 3mm acrylic and provide mounting for the fans and power delivery components. </p><p>One of the things I was worried about in having such a confined enclosure for the Raspberry Pi&apos;s was the port accessibility if I ever needed to use the HDMI ports for some reason. That is why I implemented the slots into the sides of the design. Not only do they aesthetically look cool if you side the acrylic panel out the back of the part they are perfectly lined up with the ports on the side of all the Raspberry Pi&apos;s so if needed I can still use those ports without having to ever take out any of RPI&apos;s.</p><p>On that note, some may notice that the traditional way that the Pi&apos;s receive power, the micro USB port on the side of the PCB, would be completely inaccessible in its current state. One solution that many have used online is to power the Raspberry Pi&apos;s through the 5v GPIO headers as they can actually take a power input. While this would work and would be pretty easy to implement, one of the downfalls of powering the Pi&apos;s directly from the 5v line is that your input voltage does not go through any of the filtering or reverse polarity protection that it would when powering over USB.</p><p>As I don&apos;t trust myself enough to risk 4 Raspberry Pi&apos;s at once I needed a better solution. After doing some research and probing with my multimeter I concluded that there are actually a couple of pads on the PCB below the USB port for 5v and GND. &#xA0;These are where the USB port actually connects to the PCB so you still retain the filtering and protection.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster" loading="lazy" width="640" height="417" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-15.png 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/image-15.png 640w"><figcaption>5V pads in red, GND in black</figcaption></figure><p>Although soldering directly to Pi&apos;s seems like a much more drastic measure to take I thought that it was worth the risk and that it was the solution that I ended up going with.</p><p>Next, I needed to tackle the cooling. Admittedly, this is where I went a bit overkill. I initially wanted to use the <em>NF-A4x20 PWM </em>fans by Noctua.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A4x20-PWM-Premium-Quality-Quiet/dp/B071W93333?ref=caden-kraft"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Amazon.com: Noctua NF-A4x20 PWM, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (40x20mm, Brown) : Electronics</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Buy Noctua NF-A4x20 PWM, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (40x20mm, Brown): Case Fans - Amazon.com &#x2713; FREE DELIVERY possible on eligible purchases</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.amazon.com/favicon.ico" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Brand Noctua</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Hardware Canucks</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:131-1497628-5249452:A1AJNEYGNB5H8ADYTEGZ$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fstaticb%26id%3DA1AJNEYGNB5H8ADYTEGZ%26pty%3DError%26spty%3DPageNotFound%26pti%3D:1000" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster"></div></a></figure><p>However, at almost $15 each, $30 for cooling 4 $30 computers just didn&apos;t really make a lot of sense. Then I came up with a different idea. As the length of the network switch afforded me extra room between the Pi&apos;s and the back of the cluster, the fans that I chose could be quite thick. This led me to pick 40mm server fans to use in the design.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/image-16.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster" loading="lazy" width="456" height="450"></figure><p>After they arrived I was disappointed to find out that the reviews of the fans being unbearably loud were true after some preliminary testing. However, they did push an unimaginable amount of air for their size so I decided to come up with a solution to tackle the noise. </p><p>My first idea was to hook up the PWM headers on the fans to the extra GPIO headers on one of the Raspberry Pi&apos;s and control it through temperature but that quickly became too far out of my element and probably out of the scope of the project. I decided to do the fan control the old-fashioned way by manually adjusting the voltage of the fans. To accomplish this I used a LM2596 Buck converter to limit the input voltage to the fans thus limiting the noise.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/image-20.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster" loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/image-20.png 600w"><figcaption>LM2596 DC-DC Buck Converter</figcaption></figure><p>After some testing, I concluded that the optimum level for the fan speed was setting them to just 3 volts! Normally I would think that the fans wouldn&apos;t even be capable of spinning 9 volts under their rating but not only did they spin, when they were mounted into the enclosure I could feel a steady stream of airflow even through the USB ports.</p><p><strong>Putting everything together</strong></p><p>Now that all the systems have been explained it&apos;s finally time to show off what it looks like put together. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/view1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/view1.jpg 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/view1.jpg 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/view1.jpg 1600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/view1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>View of the front with all of the Raspberry Pi&apos;s connected</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/view2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/view2.jpg 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/view2.jpg 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/view2.jpg 1600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/view2.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>All of the Pi&apos;s powered and working</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/2022/02/view3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building a Single Part Tool-less Raspberry Pi Compute Cluster" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" thisisbuggedatm="https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/view3.jpg 600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/view3.jpg 1000w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/view3.jpg 1600w, https://cadenkraft.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/02/view3.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Back wiring and fan controller</figcaption></figure><p>As seen in these photos there were some things added that I forgot to mention including the fan filters and power switch etc. Overall I think it came out really well and surprisingly accurate to my original CAD model.</p><p><strong>So what do I actually use it for?</strong></p><p>This is the main question that people are asked when you make these types of cluster projects is what people actually use them for.
